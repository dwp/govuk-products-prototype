    <p>Use this service if you were expecting one of the following a Cost of Living Payments but have not received it:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>£301 paid between 25 April and 17 May 2023 for most people</li>
      <li>£300 paid between 31 October and 19 November 2023 for most people</li>
      <li>£150 Disability Cost of Living Payment paid between 20 June and 4 July for most people</li>
      </ul>
    
<p>You'll need your National Insurance number. If you've lost your National Insurance number, check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/lost-national-insurance-number">how to find a lost National Insurance number</a>.</p>

  <p>Before reporting a missing payment, check your bank, building society or credit union account, or your Payment Exception Service voucher receipt. The payment will be made separately from your benefit.</p>

    <p>You do not need to contact us about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-of-living-payment">future Cost of Living Payments</a>. You'll be paid automatically if you're entitled.</p>

      <p>Do not report the same missing payment more than once. We will reply to you as soon as we can.</p>
