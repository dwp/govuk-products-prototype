      If you think you should have had the £301, £300 or £299 payment for tax credits from HMRC by now, but you cannot see it
      in your bank, building society or credit union account, you can contact HMRC to check.</p>

    <p>Telephone: 0345 300 3900 <br> <a href="https://www.relayuk.bt.com/">Relay UK</a> if you cannot hear or speak on
      the phone: dial 18001 then 0345 300 3900 <br> Monday to Friday: 8am to 6pm</p>

    <p>If you get tax credits from HMRC and a low income benefit from DWP, you will get a Cost of Living Payment from
      DWP only.</p>
